    "\n",
    "- Join the cleaned tables into a consolidated dataset at the order level  \n",
    "- Clean and standardize the merged dataset (e.g., data types, missing values)  \n",
    "- Create new features to capture relevant aspects of orders, products, payments etc.\n",
    "- Export the final dataset for analysis\n",
