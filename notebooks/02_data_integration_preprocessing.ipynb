    "This notebook is part of a larger project exploring customer satisfaction in Brazilian e-commerce using the [Olist dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).  \n",
    "It builds on the cleaned datasets prepared in the previous notebook by joining them into a single analytical table, performing additional data cleaning, and engineering features to support the upcoming analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Join the cleaned tables into a consolidated dataset at the order level  \n",
    "- Clean and standardize the merged dataset (e.g., data types, missing values)  \n",
    "- Create new features to capture relevant aspects of orders, products, payments etc.\n",
    "- Export the final dataset for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook is preceded and followed by:**\n",

    "- [Data Cleaning Notebook](./01_data_cleaning.ipynb): loads and prepares the individual raw datasets for integration  \n",
    "- [Exploratory Analysis Notebook](./03_customer-satisfaction-analysis.ipynb): investigates customer satisfaction patterns and key influencing factors\n",

    "\n",
    "The missing values fall into **three distinct groups**:\n",
    "1. **Product-related attributes**  \n",
    "   - `total_order_weight`, `product_name_length`, `product_description_length`, `product_photos_qty`, `product_length_cm`, `product_height_cm`, `product_width_cm`  \n",
    "   → These values are missing for ~1,300 orders, likely due to unavailable product information or incomplete joins during merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Payment-related attributes**  \n",
    "   - `payment_types`, `n_payment_types`, `max_payment_installments`, `n_payment_records`  \n",
    "   → A single row has missing values across these columns, possibly due to an unrecorded or failed transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Delivery date columns**  \n",
    "   - `order_delivered_carrier_date`, `order_delivered_customer_date`  \n",
    "   → Although the dataset was filtered to include only orders with `order_status = 'delivered'`, a small number of delivery dates are still missing. This could be due to inconsistencies or delays in data recording on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some columns with low cardinality and repeated string values (e.g. `product_category_name`, `payment_types`, `customer_state` or `seller_state`) are currently of `object` dtype.  \n",
    "To improve memory efficiency and performance in grouping and aggregation tasks, we will convert them to the category dtype where applicable.\n",
